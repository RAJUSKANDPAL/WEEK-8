# How to Set Up a Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN

## Overview

A **Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN** enables individual client devices (e.g., laptops, home desktops) to securely connect to an Azure virtual network or on-premises site from remote locations, such as employees working from home. Unlike Site-to-Site (S2S) VPNs, P2S connections are ideal for small-scale deployments or scenarios without a VPN device on the user's location.

## Prerequisites

- **Azure Subscription**
- **A virtual network** already created in Azure (with a subnet for the VPN Gateway)
- **Certificate (Root/Client)** for authentication (or use Azure Active Directory for modern deployments)
- **Supported OS** on client machines (Windows, Linux, or macOS)

## Step-by-Step Setup Guide

### 1. Create a Virtual Network (VNet)
1. In the Azure Portal, click **Create a resource** > search for **Virtual Network**.
2. Fill basics: Subscription, Resource group, VNet name, and Region.
3. Add an address space (e.g., `10.1.0.0/16`).
4. Create at least one subnet, e.g., `10.1.0.0/24` for general use and another for the Gateway.

### 2. Create the Virtual Network Gateway
1. Go to **Create a resource** > search for **Virtual Network Gateway**.
2. Select VPN as the gateway type, Route-based for VPN type, and choose the VNet created.
3. Assign a Gateway subnet (e.g., `10.1.255.0/27`).
4. Select appropriate SKU based on performance needs.
5. Deploy (can take 20â€“45 minutes).

### 3. Generate Certificates (If Using Cert Authentication)
- **Root Certificate**: Create using tools like PowerShell or OpenSSL:

- **Client Certificates**: Generated and then signed by Root:  
- Export the certificates in base-64 format.

### 4. Configure the Point-to-Site VPN on Azure
1. Go to **Virtual Network Gateway** in Azure Portal.
2. In the left pane, select **Point-to-site configuration**.
3. Click **Configure now** if not already set up.
4. **Address pool**: Enter the client address range (e.g., `172.16.201.0/24`). Ensure it doesn't overlap with your VNet or on-premises network.
5. **Tunnel type**: Choose supported protocols (IKEv2, SSTP, OpenVPN).
6. **Authentication type**: Choose Certificate or Azure AD.
 - For Cert Auth: Provide root cert data (copy .cer file contents here).
 - For Azure AD: Configure tenant settings as guided.
7. Click **Save**.

### 5. Download and Install the VPN Client
1. Once saved, on the same page, click **Download VPN client**.
2. Extract the zip on your client system. Choose the appropriate installer (Windows, macOS, Linux).
3. Install the VPN client software.

### 6. Connect the Client Device
1. On **Windows**: Run the installer, import configuration, and connect via the OS VPN interface or Azure VPN client.
2. On **macOS/Linux**: Use the OpenVPN client and import the `.ovpn` or `.xml` config files.
3. Authenticate (with certificate or Azure AD, per your original setup).
4. After successful authentication, your client will receive an IP from the pool and can access resources in the Virtual Network.

## Additional Tips

- **Testing**: Ensure your firewall rules/NACLs allow the inbound and outbound VPN connections.
- **Multiple Clients**: Distribute client certificates as needed.
- **Security**: Use strong certs and optionally enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) via Azure AD.
- **Troubleshooting**: Check that certificates are valid, the right protocol is used, and the address pool/subnets do not overlap.
