📚 R&D on VPN Configurations 🛡️  
Welcome! This repository serves as a comprehensive reference for setting up secure VPN connections between on-premises infrastructure and Microsoft Azure ☁️. It includes in-depth research and step-by-step documentation for configuring both Point-to-Site (P2S) 🔐 and Site-to-Site (S2S) 🌐 VPNs. The P2S section guides individual client setups to securely connect to an Azure Virtual Network, while the S2S guide demonstrates how to create a persistent VPN tunnel using Hyper-V 🖥️ for seamless network-to-network communication.
